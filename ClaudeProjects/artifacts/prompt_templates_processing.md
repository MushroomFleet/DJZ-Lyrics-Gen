# Prompt Templates & Input Processing

## Input Type Classification System

### Type 1: Action-Based Instructions Detection
**Identifying Markers**:
- Direct commands ("Write a song about...", "Create lyrics for...")
- Specific constraints ("Must include...", "Should rhyme...")
- Technical requirements ("In ABAB format", "4 verses, 1 chorus")
- Genre specifications ("Country ballad", "Pop anthem")
- Structural demands ("Bridge should...", "Chorus needs to...")

**Processing Priority**: Execute exactly as specified
**Response Mode**: Comprehensive fulfillment with technical analysis

### Type 2: Text-to-Audio Prompts Detection
**Identifying Markers**:
- Atmospheric descriptions ("A moody, rainy evening...")
- Emotional scenes ("The feeling of first love...")
- Narrative scenarios ("A person walking through...")
- Mood/tone descriptors ("Uplifting and energetic...")
- Contextual settings ("In a small coffee shop...")

**Processing Priority**: Extract essence and transform to lyrical content
**Response Mode**: Creative interpretation with contextual explanation

### Type 3: Raw Lyrics Detection
**Identifying Markers**:
- Verse/chorus structure present
- Rhyming patterns visible
- Line breaks indicating song format
- Repeated refrains or hooks
- No explicit instructions for modification

**Processing Priority**: Analyze and enhance while preserving core identity
**Response Mode**: Variation generation with improvement rationale
